								<p> Hello and welcome! This vault of mine is a platform I made that houses my hidden passions for writing, world building, and traditional art. It also shines a light on those who have helped me along the way in my writing journey as a new short fantasy author. </p>
								<p> If you have seen this website before, it went through a massive overhaul. I realized that it had a little too much of everything, and therefore wasn't concentrated in a way I would have liked. I do hope that now, anyone entering my vault will not be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the site and more easily navigate through my wares. </p>
								<p> "Having too many options is the same as having none." <p>
								
								<p> Tell your friends, tell your family, and subscribe to my weekly <a href="https://mailchi.mp/c120e350d1cd/sarkahns-imaginarium">newsletter</a>! </p>
								<p> I also post weekly articles on my <a href="https://medium.com/@alexandredmurray/about">Medium page</a> on a variety of topics.
								
								<p> Please look forward for more to enter the vault because I am always adding something new! My author page can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/author/sarkahn_am">here</a>. Enjoy. </p>

									<p> All of my nonfiction blog content can be found on Medium by using the button below!</p>
									<p> As a Game Master, my starting point was learning how to world build using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Dungeon-Rulebook-Roleplaying/dp/0786965622/ref=sr_1_15?crid=3QPP9JNRO4HKQ&amp;keywords=D%2526D&amp;qid=1681223345&amp;sprefix=d%2526d%252Caps%252C204&amp;sr=8-15&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=sarkahnsvault-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=7a77801518c2cb8a838842f6d93ed888&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dungeon Master Guide</a>!</p>
									<p> This was my starting point into writing, world building and learning how to be an effective Game Master! If I could do it all over again, I would do the same thing without hesitation.</p>
									<p> I want as many people to enjoy the worlds they create for games, books and everything in between so I will do my best to publish some articles about what I did multiple times a week. A difficult task but one I plan to accomplish.</p>
